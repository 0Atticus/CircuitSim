---

Open the website [here](https://0atticus.github.io/CircuitSim/)


## Direction:
---
> click on the buttons on the left side to spawn a chip
> the input button creates a signal source
> the table button creates a truth table for the given circuit
> the save button allows you to download your circuit to your computer (it does not save automatically, please do this if you want to keep working on your project)
> the load button allows you to upload a file and load the circuit on it
> the text button creates a comment/label (right-click to edit)

> double click to start dragging a chip and single click to drop it
> click on a signal source (either on the left side of the screen or an output from a chip) and click on its destination.
> right click on the signal sources on the left side to toggle them.
> the circle on the right side of the screen is the output (there is only one at the moment, I hope to add more complex outputs)
